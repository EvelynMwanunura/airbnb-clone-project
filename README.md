## TechnologyStack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Provides powerful tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system used for reliable data storage and management.  
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient querying of data, allowing clients to request only the data they need.  
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications and processing background jobs.  
- **Redis**: Used for caching, message brokering, and session management to improve performance.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing, building, and deployment of code changes for faster and more reliable releases.

## DatabseDesign
The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is designed to support core functionality such as user management, property listings, booking operations, reviews, and payments. Below is a breakdown of the key entities, their important fields, and relationships.

### Entities & Fields

#### 1. Users
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each user
- `name` â€“ full name of the user
- `email` â€“ unique email address
- `password_hash` â€“ securely stored password
- `role` â€“ indicates if the user is a host, guest, or admin

#### 2. Properties
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each property
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the owner (host) from Users
- `title` â€“ name/short description of the property
- `location` â€“ address or city of the property
- `price_per_night` â€“ cost of booking per night

#### 3. Bookings
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each booking
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the guest who made the booking
- `property_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the booked property
- `start_date` â€“ check-in date
- `end_date` â€“ check-out date
- `status` â€“ booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

#### 4. Reviews
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each review
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the guest who left the review
- `property_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the property being reviewed
- `rating` â€“ numerical rating (e.g., 1â€“5)
- `comment` â€“ text feedback from the user

#### 5. Payments
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the booking being paid for
- `amount` â€“ total payment amount
- `payment_method` â€“ e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status` â€“ payment status (pending, successful, failed)

### Relationships

- **Users â†’ Properties**: One user (host) can list multiple properties.
- **Users â†’ Bookings**: One user (guest) can create multiple bookings.
- **Properties â†’ Bookings**: A property can have many bookings.
- **Bookings â†’ Payments**: Each booking has one corresponding payment.
- **Properties â†’ Reviews**: A property can have many reviews.
- **Users â†’ Reviews**: A user can leave multiple reviews.

This relational structure ensures scalability, data integrity, and alignment with real-world Airbnb-like workflows.

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone Project includes several core features that replicate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. These features are designed to provide a seamless experience for both hosts and guests while ensuring system reliability and security.

### 1. User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. The system supports different roles such as guests, hosts, and admins, ensuring personalized access and functionality.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, update details, set availability, and manage pricing. This feature enables the platform to showcase diverse accommodation options for guests.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can browse available properties, make reservations, and manage their bookings. This feature ensures that scheduling, availability, and conflicts are handled efficiently.

### 4. Review System
Guests can leave feedback and ratings for properties they have stayed in. Reviews enhance trust and help future guests make informed booking decisions.

### 5. Payment Processing
The system integrates secure payment handling for bookings. It supports multiple payment methods and ensures transaction safety, providing confidence to both hosts and guests.

### 6. Security & Authentication
Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to protect user data and restrict access. This feature ensures only authorized users can perform sensitive actions like booking, reviewing, or listing properties.

### 7. CI/CD Pipeline Integration
The project includes a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and smooth deployment. This ensures efficiency, reduces manual errors, and supports agile team collaboration.
