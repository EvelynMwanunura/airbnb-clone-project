##TechnologyStack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Provides powerful tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system used for reliable data storage and management.  
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient querying of data, allowing clients to request only the data they need.  
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications and processing background jobs.  
- **Redis**: Used for caching, message brokering, and session management to improve performance.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing, building, and deployment of code changes for faster and more reliable releases.
