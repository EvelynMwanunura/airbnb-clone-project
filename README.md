## TechnologyStack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Provides powerful tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.  
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database system used for reliable data storage and management.  
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient querying of data, allowing clients to request only the data they need.  
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications and processing background jobs.  
- **Redis**: Used for caching, message brokering, and session management to improve performance.  
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments through containerization.  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing, building, and deployment of code changes for faster and more reliable releases.

## DatabseDesign
The database for the Airbnb Clone Project is designed to support core functionality such as user management, property listings, booking operations, reviews, and payments. Below is a breakdown of the key entities, their important fields, and relationships.

### Entities & Fields

- `role` â€“ indicates if the user is a host, guest, or admin

#### 2. Properties
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each property
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the owner (host) from Users
- `title` â€“ name/short description of the property
- `location` â€“ address or city of the property
- `price_per_night` â€“ cost of booking per night

#### 3. Bookings
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each booking
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the guest who made the booking
- `property_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the booked property
- `start_date` â€“ check-in date
- `end_date` â€“ check-out date
- `status` â€“ booking status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

#### 4. Reviews
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each review
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the guest who left the review

- `rating` â€“ numerical rating (e.g., 1â€“5)
- `comment` â€“ text feedback from the user

#### 5. Payments
- `id` (Primary Key) â€“ unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key) â€“ references the booking being paid for
- `amount` â€“ total payment amount
- `payment_method` â€“ e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status` â€“ payment status (pending, successful, failed)

### Relationships

- **Users â†’ Properties**: One user (host) can list multiple properties.
- **Users â†’ Bookings**: One user (guest) can create multiple bookings.
- **Properties â†’ Bookings**: A property can have many bookings.
- **Bookings â†’ Payments**: Each booking has one corresponding payment.
- **Properties â†’ Reviews**: A property can have many reviews.
- **Users â†’ Reviews**: A user can leave multiple reviews.

This relational structure ensures scalability, data integrity, and alignment with real-world Airbnb-like workflows.
